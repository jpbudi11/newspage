							<h1><img src="assets/arcticcat.jpg" class="img-rounded">  Arctic Cat  </h1>

							<p>Arctic Cat was formed by snowmobile pioneer <abbr title="Founder of Arctic Cat">Edgar Hetteen</abbr> in 1960 due to his departure from his previous self-started business, Polaris Industries. Like Polaris, Arctic Cat grew to become a major manufacturer of snowmobiles, watercraft, and all-terrain vehicles (ATV's). The company's first name was Polar Manufacturing but was soon changed to Arctic Enterprises. The company made their first snowmobile in 1960 and in 1970, started the Boss Cat line. Various boat manufacturers, including Silver Line, Lund and Spirit Marine, were purchased to attempt to expand the company. However, Arctic Cat went bankrupt in 1982. Two years later, a new company Arctico was created to continue the production of Arctic Cat snowmobiles.</p>
							<p>The company was successful in keeping the Arctic Cat alive and in 1996 the company changed its name to Arctic Cat. The company continues to make snowmobiles as well as all-terrain vehicles and side-by-sides. Over the years, the company has attempted many other product lines including snowblowers, generators, mini bikes, and two-wheel drive vehicles. In 1972, the production was moved to General Leisure Products Corp.</p>

							<p>One of the three founders of Polaris Industries when the company evolved from Polaris <abbr title="Founders of Polaris">Hetteen Hoist and Derrick</abbr>, Allan was the ‘junior’ partner. Nine years younger than brother Edgar, Allan was still in school when Edgar went on his own to establish Hetteen Hoist and Derrick in 1944. The elder Hetteen grew the company through the remainder of the 1940s as his boyhood friend and partner, David Johnson, was away in the US Navy, but sending home a share of his pay to help Edgar establish the new company. It was these three men who turned the operation from builders of agricultural and industrial accessories to a maker of snow machines. In1954, the three renamed the company and set off on a new direction that carries the Polaris name today.</p>

							<h1><img src="assets/skidoo.jpg" class="img-rounded">  Ski-doo  </h1>

							<p>Ski-Doo is a brand name of snowmobile fabricated by <abbr title="Skidoo still uses Bombardier today">Bombardier Recreational Products</abbr>. The first Ski-Doo was launched in 1959. It was a new invention of Joseph-Armand Bombardier. The original name was Ski-Dog, but a spelling error at the patent office caused the name to lose the "g" and gain an "o".</p>
							<p>The first Ski-Doos found customers with missionaries, trappers, and prospectors, land surveyors and other persons who need to displace themselves in snowy remote areas. The largest success for the snowmobile came from sport enthusiasts, a market that opened the door to massive production of snowmobiles.

							<h1><img src="assets/yamaha.jpg" class="img-rounded">  Yamaha  </h1>

							<p>In 2010 Yamaha <abbr title="until a couple years ago">was</abbr> the only snowmobile manufacturer to use four-stroke engines across its range. In Canada though, there are still three models that Yamaha manufactures that are still two-stroke. They are the Bravo, VK 540 and the Venture XL. Yamaha had introduced four-strokes to their line-up in 2003 and the line-up became four-stroke based for model year 2005. The RX-1 released in 2003 was the first performance-oriented four-stroke snowmobile to ever hit the market. It was not, however, the first modern four-stroke snowmobile produced. That honor belongs to Arctic Cat for their Yellowstone Special, released in 2000, which was designed as a rental sled that could meet Yellowstone National Park's stringent emission requirement. However, Yamaha received much criticism for its weight disadvantage when compared to similar two-strokes, despite its fuel economy and low-range torque. </p>
							<p>Yamaha is now on the cutting edge of four-stroke technology with the introducing of their 80FI engine which is equipped on the Phazer and Venture Lite models. This engine has one of the highest specific output of any four-stroke in production, with 160 HP/L, Yamaha achieves this even without the use of a forced induction system. Yamaha is also a key player in the "four-stroke wars", which are a series of advertisements from opponent Ski-Doo who claim their E-tec and power-tec equipped two-strokes are still cleaner and more efficient than four-strokes, while Yamaha still claims the four-strokes are cleaner. Yamaha also broke a multi-year absence from sno-cross in the winter of 2006/2007 with their introduction of a factory race team headed by former Arctic Cat racer Robbie Malinoski.</p>
