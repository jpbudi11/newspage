    @arcticcat = "Arctic Cat was formed by snowmobile pioneer
		  Edgar Hetteen in 1960 due to his departure from his previous self-started business, 
		  Polaris Industries. Like Polaris, Arctic Cat grew to become a major manufacturer of snowmobiles, 
		  watercraft, and all-terrain vehicles (ATV's). The company's first name was Polar Manufacturing but
		   was soon changed to Arctic Enterprises. The company made their first snowmobile in 1960 and in 1970,
		    started the Boss Cat line. Various boat manufacturers, including Silver Line, Lund and Spirit Marine,
		     were purchased to attempt to expand the company. However, Arctic Cat went bankrupt in 1982. Two years
		      later, a new company Arctico was created to continue the production of Arctic Cat snowmobiles.
		The company was successful in keeping the Arctic Cat alive and in 1996 the company changed its name 
		to Arctic Cat. The company continues to make snowmobiles as well as all-terrain vehicles and side-by-sides. 
		Over the years, the company has attempted many other product lines including snowblowers, generators, mini 
		bikes, and two-wheel drive vehicles. In 1972, the production was moved to General Leisure Products Corp."
		@polaris = "One of the three founders of Polaris Industries when the company evolved from Polaris 
		  Hetteen Hoist and Derrick, Allan was the junior partner. Nine years younger than brother Edgar, Allan 
		  was still in school when Edgar went on his own to establish Hetteen Hoist and Derrick in 1944. The elder 
		  Hetteen grew the company through the remainder of the 1940s as his boyhood friend and partner, David Johnson,
		   was away in the US Navy, but sending home a share of his pay to help Edgar establish the new company. It was 
		   these three men who turned the operation from builders of agricultural and industrial accessories to a maker 
		   of snow machines. In1954, the three renamed the company and set off on a new direction that carries the Polaris
		    name today."
		@skidoo = "Ski-Doo is a brand name of snowmobile fabricated by Bombardier Recreational Products. The 
		  first Ski-Doo was launched in 1959. It was a new invention of Joseph-Armand Bombardier. The original name was Ski-Dog,
		   but a spelling error at the patent office caused the name to lose the G and gain an O.
				The first Ski-Doos found customers with missionaries, trappers, and prospectors, land surveyors and other persons 
				who need to displace themselves in snowy remote areas. The largest success for the snowmobile came from sport
				 enthusiasts, a market that opened the door to massive production of snowmobiles."
				 		@yamaha = "In 2010 Yamaha the only snowmobile 
		  manufacturer to use four-stroke engines across its range. In Canada though, there are still three 
		  models that Yamaha manufactures that are still two-stroke. They are the Bravo, VK 540 and the Venture 
		  XL. Yamaha had introduced four-strokes to their line-up in 2003 and the line-up became four-stroke based
		   for model year 2005. The RX-1 released in 2003 was the first performance-oriented four-stroke snowmobile
		      to ever hit the market. It was not, however, the first modern four-stroke snowmobile produced. That honor
		       belongs to Arctic Cat for their Yellowstone Special, released in 2000, which was designed as a rental sled
		        that could meet Yellowstone National Park's stringent emission requirement. However, Yamaha received much
		         criticism for its weight disadvantage when compared to similar two-strokes, despite its fuel economy and
		          low-range torque.
							Yamaha is now on the cutting edge of four-stroke technology with the introducing of their 80FI engine 
							which is equipped on the Phazer and Venture Lite models. This engine has one of the highest specific 
							output of any four-stroke in production, with 160 HP/L, Yamaha achieves this even without the use of a 
							forced induction system. Yamaha is also a key player in the four-stroke wars, which are a series of 
							advertisements from opponent Ski-Doo who claim their E-tec and power-tec equipped two-strokes are still 
							cleaner and more efficient than four-strokes, while Yamaha still claims the four-strokes are cleaner. 
							Yamaha also broke a multi-year absence from sno-cross in the winter of 2006/2007 with their introduction
							 of a factory race team headed by former Arctic Cat racer Robbie Malinoski."
